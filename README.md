# logistics-id/engine

**Engine** is a powerful, production-ready framework for rapidly developing Go microservices at [logistics-id](https://github.com/logistics-id).

Engine accelerates microservice delivery by providing robust, integrated libraries for essential infrastructure, including databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis), message brokers (RabbitMQ), and transport protocols (REST, gRPC). Its built-in lifecycle management, structured logging, and unified architecture eliminate boilerplate and complexity.

With Engine, development can confidently build, deploy, and scale microservices faster‚Äîfocusing purely on delivering impactful business logic, not managing infrastructure.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Lifecycle hooks:** Register `OnStart` and `OnStop` functions for any dependency.
- **Signal handling:** Handles `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` for graceful shutdown.
- **Centralized config and structured logging:** Built-in logger with [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap).
- **Modular libraries:** Built-in for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, REST, gRPC, and more.

## üì° Built-in Communication Libraries

This engine package provides robust, production-ready libraries for working with external systems and inter-service communication, including:

- **Data Stores:**
  - **MongoDB**: `engine/ds/mongo` ‚Äî Full-featured library for MongoDB operations and lifecycle management.
  - **PostgreSQL**: `engine/ds/postgres` ‚Äî Abstraction for PostgreSQL with connection pooling and helpers.
  - **Redis**: `engine/ds/redis` ‚Äî Fast access and management of Redis with ready-to-use utilities.
- **Message Brokers:**
  - **RabbitMQ**: `engine/broker/rabbitmq` ‚Äî Complete AMQP (RabbitMQ) client with publisher/subscriber abstractions and reliability features.
- **Transport Protocols:**
  - **gRPC**: `engine/protocol/grpc` ‚Äî Idiomatic server/client layer, service discovery, and registry integration.
  - **REST**: `engine/protocol/rest` ‚Äî Flexible HTTP/REST server with built-in middleware and error handling.

Each library exposes standardized initialization and shutdown APIs, and includes patterns for logging, context propagation, and best practices.

## üìù Example: `main.go`

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "os"

    "github.com/joho/godotenv"

    "github.com/logistics-id/engine"
    "github.com/logistics-id/engine/ds/mongo"
    "github.com/logistics-id/engine/broker/rabbitmq"
    "github.com/logistics-id/engine/transport/rest"

    "github.com/yourrepo/service/proto"
)

func init() {
    godotenv.Load()
	engine.Init(proto.ServiceName)
}

func main() {
    engine.OnStart(func(ctx context.Context) error {
		mongo.NewConnection(mongo.ConfigDefault(os.Getenv("MONGODB_DATABASE")), engine.Logger)

		return rabbitmq.NewConnection(rabbitmq.ConfigDefault(engine.Config.Name), engine.Logger)
    })

    engine.OnStop(func(ctx context.Context) {
        rabbitmq.CloseConnection()
         mongo.CloseConnection()
    })

    engine.Run(func(ctx context.Context) {
        restServer := rest.NewServer(&rest.Config{
            Server:    os.Getenv("REST_SERVER"),
            IsDev:     engine.Config.IsDev,
            JwtSecret: os.Getenv("JWT_SECRET"),
        }, engine.Logger, registerRoutes)
        go restServer.Start(ctx)
        defer restServer.Shutdown(ctx)

        <-ctx.Done()
    })
}
```
